# react-parcel-demo

A sample repository using Parcel bundler for React applications

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the dependencies.<br>

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode with hot reloading.<br>
Now, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for the production mode.<br>

## Todo

As of now the parcel bundler does not support babel.config.js, once the support is present, need to replace .babelrc with babel.config.js
